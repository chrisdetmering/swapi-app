# SWAPI - Who's Who in the Star Wars Universe

This project uses [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) to display a table of characters from Star Wars and their associated info (height, birth year, home planet, etc.). You can navigate through the list of characters by using the Next and Prev buttons, or search for your favorite character(s) using the search bar.

### SWAPI - The Star Wars API

The table is populated with data pulled from SWAPI, an open source API that contains a lot of information related to the Star Wars movies. This application mainly uses the character information (https://swapi.dev/api/people/) but you can also pull information on planets, starships, species, and more! 

You can view their full documentation here: [SWAPI](https://swapi.dev/)
